# URL Shortener 101

I decided to complete this project in rails instead of elixir/phoenix basically because I was under time constraints and thought I could get it done faster. I may attempt an e/p implementation anyway just for fun.

To run:

* assume a local ruby installation is functional
* bundle install
* bundle exec rails server





Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
